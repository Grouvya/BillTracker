# BillTracker Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: February 11, 2026**

BillTracker ("the App") is developed as a local-first, privacy-focused financial management tool. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to your data security.

## 1. Information Collection and Use
BillTracker **does not collect, store, or transmit** any personal or financial information to the developer or any third parties. 
- All data entered into the App follows a "Local-Only" architecture.
- Your financial records, bill details, and savings goals are stored exclusively on your own device.

## 2. Data Security and Encryption
To ensure the maximum level of privacy, BillTracker utilizes:
- **AES-256 Encryption**: All local database files are encrypted using the industry-standard Fernet (cryptography) architecture.
- **PIN Protection**: Access to your data is guarded by a user-defined PIN.
- **No Cloud Sync**: Because there is no cloud synchronization, the developer has no way to access, recover, or see your data.

## 3. Application Permissions
The App requires the `runFullTrust` capability for the following strictly functional purposes:
- **Filesystem Access**: To save and load your encrypted database file and configuration settings.
- **PDF Generation**: To create and save financial reports and audits directly to your storage.

## 4. Third-Party Analytics
We do not use tracking pixels, cookies, or third-party analytics services. Your usage habits remain private.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by the "Effective Date" at the top of this document.

## 6. Contact Us
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can reach out via the Contact button in the App's About tab.
